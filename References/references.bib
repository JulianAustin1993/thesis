	abstract = {It is of utmost importance to have a clear understanding of the status of air pollution and to provide forecasts and insights about the air quality to the general public and researchers in environmental studies. Previous studies of spatio-temporal models showed that even a shortterm exposure to high concentrations of atmospheric ﬁne particulate matters can be hazardous to the health of ordinary people. In this study, we develop a spatio-temporal model with space-time interaction for air pollution data (PM2.5). The proposed model uses a parametric space-time interaction component along with the spatial and temporal components in the mean structure, and introduces a random-eﬀects component speciﬁed in the form of zeromean spatio-temporal processes. For application, we analyze the air pollution data (PM2.5) from 66 monitoring stations across Taiwan.},

	abstract = {The assumption of separability of the covariance operator for a random image or hypersurface can be of substantial use in applications, especially in situations where the accurate estimation of the full covariance structure is unfeasible, either for computational reasons, or due to a small sample size. However, inferential tools to verify this assumption are somewhat lacking in high-dimensional or functional data analysis settings, where this assumption is most relevant. We propose here to test separability by focusing on KKK-dimensional projections of the difference between the covariance operator and a nonparametric separable approximation. The subspace we project onto is one generated by the eigenfunctions of the covariance operator estimated under the separability hypothesis, negating the need to ever estimate the full nonseparable covariance. We show that the rescaled difference of the sample covariance operator with its separable approximation is asymptotically Gaussian. As a by-product of this result, we derive asymptotically pivotal tests under Gaussian assumptions, and propose bootstrap methods for approximating the distribution of the test statistics. We probe the finite sample performance through simulations studies, and present an application to log-spectrogram images from a phonetic linguistics dataset.},

The test is developed in the context of multivariate repeated measures (for example, several variables measured at multiple times on many subjects), but can also apply to a replicated spatio-temporal process and to problems in meteorology, where horizontal and vertical covariances are often assumed to be separable. Separable models are a common way to model spatio-temporal covariances because of the computational benefits resulting from the joint space–time covariance being factored into the product of a covariance function that depends only on space and a covariance function that depends only on time. We show that when the null hypothesis of separability holds, the distribution of the test statistic does not depend on the type of separable model. Thus, it is possible to develop reference distributions of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. These distributions are used to evaluate the power of the test for certain nonseparable models. The test does not require second-order stationarity, isotropy, or specification of a covariance model. We apply the test to a multivariate repeated measures problem.},

	abstract = {Most applications in spatial statistics involve modeling of complex spatial–temporal dependency structures, and many of the problems of space and time modeling can be overcome by using separable processes. This subclass of spatial–temporal processes has several advantages, including rapid fitting and simple extensions of many techniques developed and successfully used in time series and classical geostatistics. In particular, a major advantage of these processes is that the covariance matrix for a realization can be expressed as the Kronecker product of two smaller matrices that arise separately from the temporal and purely spatial processes, and hence its determinant and inverse are easily determinable. However, these separable models are not always realistic, and there are no formal tests for separability of general spatial–temporal processes. We present here a formal method to test for separability. Our approach can be also used to test for lack of stationarity of the process. The beauty of our approach is that by using spectral methods the mechanics of the test can be reduced to a simple two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure. The approach we propose is based on only one realization of the spatial–temporal process. We apply the statistical methods proposed here to test for separability and stationarity of spatial–temporal ozone fields using data provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).},

	abstract = {Oil spills represent a major threat to ocean ecosystems and their health. Illicit pollution requires continuous monitoring and satellite remote sensing technology represents an attractive option for operational oil spill detection. Previous studies have shown that active microwave satellite sensors, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can be effectively used for the detection and classification of oil spills. Oil spills appear as dark spots in SAR images. However, similar dark spots may arise from a range of unrelated meteorological and oceanographic phenomena, resulting in misidentification. A major focus of research in this area is the development of algorithms to distinguish oil spills from `look-alikes'. This paper describes the development of a new approach to SAR oil spill detection employing two different Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), used in sequence. The first ANN segments a SAR image to identify pixels belonging to candidate oil spill features. A set of statistical feature parameters are then extracted and used to drive a second ANN which classifies objects into oil spills or look-alikes. The proposed algorithm was trained using 97 ERS-2 SAR and ENVSAT ASAR images of individual verified oil spills or/and look-alikes. The algorithm was validated using a large dataset comprising full-swath images and correctly identified 91.6\% of reported oil spills and 98.3\% of look-alike phenomena. The segmentation stage of the new technique outperformed the established edge detection and adaptive thresholding approaches. An analysis of feature descriptors highlighted the importance of image gradient information in the classification stage.},

To accomplish this, the European Union (EU)-led GMES programme comprises three components namely the space component, the in-situ component and the service component. The space component, led by ESA, is in its pre-operational stage, serving users with satellite data acquired by the so called “GMES Contributing Missions” already available today or planned at European, national and international level. It will become operational once the dedicated space infrastructure, comprised by the “Sentinel” missions and their corresponding ground segments are operational. The first of these satellite series will be launched in 2013. The Sentinel missions will provide a unique set of observations utilising different techniques spanning C-band SAR, mid to medium resolution optical and thermal observations with increased spectral resolution, altimeter and dedicated spectrometers for atmospheric chemistry. This data, combined with in-situ data, some assimilated into models, will then be turned into services for monitoring the environment, the climate and for security related issues. The GMES Space Component (GSC) is organised in two overlapping phases: the development phase and the operational phase, the latter planned to start in 2014. The main challenge is now to ensure the programme's long-term sustainability.},

Unfortunately, the analysis of longitudinal imaging data is complicated by inherent spatial and temporal correlation: the temporal from the repeated measures, and the spatial from the outcomes of interest being observed at multiple points in a patients body. We propose the use of a linear model with a separable parametric spatiotemporal error structure for the analysis of repeated imaging data. The model makes use of spatial (exponential, spherical, and Matérn) and temporal (compound symmetric, autoregressive-1, Toeplitz, and unstructured) parametric correlation functions., A simulation study, inspired by a longitudinal cardiac imaging study on mitral regurgitation patients, compared different information criteria for selecting a particular separable parametric spatiotemporal correlation structure as well as the effects on Type I and II error rates for inference on fixed effects when the specified model is incorrect. Information criteria were found to be highly accurate at choosing between separable parametric spatiotemporal correlation structures. Misspecification of the covariance structure was found to have the ability to inflate the Type I error or have an overly conservative test size, which corresponded to decreased power., An example with clinical data is given illustrating how the covariance structure procedure can be done in practice, as well as how covariance structure choice can change inferences about fixed effects.},

	abstract = {The P-splines of Eilers and Marx (1996) combine a B-spline basis with a discrete quadratic penalty on the basis coefﬁcients, to produce a reduced rank spline like smoother. P-splines have three properties that make them very popular as reduced rank smoothers: i) the basis and the penalty are sparse, enabling efﬁcient computation, especially for Bayesian stochastic simulation; ii) it is possible to ﬂexibly ‘mix-and-match’ the order of B-spline basis and penalty, rather than the order of penalty controlling the order of the basis as in spline smoothing; iii) it is very easy to set up the Bspline basis functions and penalties. The discrete penalties are somewhat less interpretable in terms of function shape than the traditional derivative based spline penalties, but tend towards penalties proportional to traditional spline penalties in the limit of large basis size. However part of the point of P-splines is not to use a large basis size. In addition the spline basis functions arise from solving functional optimization problems involving derivative based penalties, so moving to discrete penalties for smoothing may not always be desirable. The purpose of this note is to point out that the three properties of basis-penalty sparsity, mix-and-match penalization and ease of setup are readily obtainable with B-splines subject to derivative based penalization. The penalty setup typically requires a few lines of code, rather than the two lines typically required for P-splines, but this one off disadvantage seems to be the only one associated with using derivative based penalties. As an example application, it is shown how basis-penalty sparsity enables efﬁcient computation with tensor product smoothers of scattered data.},

SAR-based change detection approaches offer a great opportunity to enhance our understanding of complex and dynamic ecosystems. We test a recently-developed time series change detection approach (S1-omnibus) using Sentinel-1 imagery of two wetlands with different ecological characteristics; a seasonal isolated wetland in southern Spain and a coastal wetland in the south of France. We test the S1-omnibus method against a commonly-used pairwise comparison of consecutive images to demonstrate its advantages. Additionally, we compare it with a pairwise change detection method using a subset of consecutive Landsat images for the same period of time. The results show how S1-omnibus is capable of capturing in space and time changes produced by water surface dynamics, as well as by agricultural practices, whether they are sudden changes, as well as gradual. S1-omnibus is capable of detecting a wider array of short-term changes than when using consecutive pairs of Sentinel-1 images. When compared to the Landsat-based change detection method, both show an overall good agreement, although certain landscape changes are detected only by either the Landsat-based or the S1-omnibus method. The S1-omnibus method shows a great potential for an automated monitoring of short time changes and accurate delineation of areas of high variability and of slow and gradual changes.},

	abstract = {We propose a nonparametric method to perform functional principal components analysis for the case of sparse longitudinal data. The method aims at irregularly spaced longitudinal data, where the number of repeated measurements available per subject is small. In contrast, classical functional data analysis requires a large number of regularly spaced measurements per subject. We assume that the repeated measurements are located randomly with a random number of repetitions for each subject and are determined by an underlying smooth random (subject-specific) trajectory plus measurement errors. Basic elements of our approach are the parsimonious estimation of the covariance structure and mean function of the trajectories, and the estimation of the variance of the measurement errors. The eigenfunction basis is estimated from the data, and functional principal components score estimates are obtained by a conditioning step. This conditional estimation method is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. A key step is the derivation of asymptotic consistency and distribution results under mild conditions, using tools from functional analysis. Functional data analysis for sparse longitudinal data enables prediction of individual smooth trajectories even if only one or few measurements are available for a subject. Asymptotic pointwise and simultaneous confidence bands are obtained for predicted individual trajectories, based on asymptotic distributions, for simultaneous bands under the assumption of a finite number of components. Model selection techniques, such as the Akaike information criterion, are used to choose the model dimension corresponding to the number of eigenfunctions in the model. The methods are illustrated with a simulation study, longitudinal CD4 data for a sample of AIDS patients, and time-course gene expression data for the yeast cell cycle.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the analysis of spatially correlated functional data. We propose a parametric model for spatial correlation and the between-curve correlation is modeled by correlating functional principal component scores of the functional data. Additionally, in the sparse observation framework, we propose a novel approach of spatial principal analysis by conditional expectation to explicitly estimate spatial correlations and reconstruct individual curves. Assuming spatial stationarity, empirical spatial correlations are calculated as the ratio of eigenvalues of the smoothed covariance surface Cov\$\$(X\_i(s),X\_i(t))\$\$(Xi(s),Xi(t))and cross-covariance surface Cov\$\$(X\_i(s), X\_j(t))\$\$(Xi(s),Xj(t))at locations indexed by i and j. Then a anisotropy Matérn spatial correlation model is fitted to empirical correlations. Finally, principal component scores are estimated to reconstruct the sparsely observed curves. This framework can naturally accommodate arbitrary covariance structures, but there is an enormous reduction in computation if one can assume the separability of temporal and spatial components. We demonstrate the consistency of our estimates and propose hypothesis tests to examine the separability as well as the isotropy effect of spatial correlation. Using simulation studies, we show that these methods have some clear advantages over existing methods of curve reconstruction and estimation of model parameters.},

Optical imagery can provide invaluable insights into crop growth and development but is severely hampered by cloud cover. This case study in the Flevopolder illustrates the potential value of Sentinel-1 for monitoring five key crops in The Netherlands, namely sugar beet, potato, maize, wheat and English rye grass. Time series of radar backscatter from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 Mission are analyzed and compared to ground measurements including phenological stage and height. Temporal variations in backscatter data reflect changes in water content and structure associated with phenological development. Emergence and closure dates are estimated from the backscatter time series and validated against a photo archive. Coherence data are compared to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and ground data, illustrating that the sudden increase in coherence is a useful indicator of harvest. The results presented here demonstrate that Sentinel-1 data have significant potential value to monitor growth and development of key Dutch crops. Furthermore, the guaranteed availability of Sentinel-1 imagery in clouded conditions ensures the reliability of data to meet the monitoring needs of farmers, food producers and regulatory bodies.},

We discuss this operational monitoring service through the case study of the Tuscany Region (Central Italy), selected due to its peculiar geological setting prone to ground instability phenomena. We set up a systematic processing chain of Sentinel-1 acquisitions to create continuously updated ground deformation data to mark the transition from static satellite analysis, based on the analysis of archive images, to dynamic monitoring of ground displacement. Displacement time series, systematically updated with the most recent available Sentinel-1 acquisition, are analysed to identify anomalous points (i.e., points where a change in the dynamic of motion is occurring). The presence of a cluster of persistent anomalies affecting elements at risk determines a significant level of risk, with the necessity of further analysis. Here, we show that the Sentinel-1 constellation can be used for continuous and systematic tracking of ground deformation phenomena at the regional scale. Our results demonstrate how satellite data, acquired with short revisiting times and promptly processed, can contribute to the detection of changes in ground deformation patterns and can act as a key information layer for risk mitigation.},

	abstract = {The Wiley Classics Library consists of selected books that have been made more accessible to consumers in an effort to increase global appeal and general circulation. With these new unabridged softcover volumes, Wiley hopes to extend the lives of these works by making them available to future generations of statisticians, mathematicians, and scientists. Spatial statistics - analyzing spatial data through statistical models - has proven exceptionally versatile, encompassing problems ranging from the microscopic to the astronomic. However, for the scientist and engineer faced only with scattered and uneven treatments of the subject in the scientific literature, learning how to make practical use of spatial statistics in day-to-day analytical work is very difficult. Designed exclusively for scientists eager to tap into the enormous potential of this analytical tool and upgrade their range of technical skills, Statistics for Spatial Data is a comprehensive, single-source guide to both the theory and applied aspects of spatial statistical methods. The hard-cover edition was hailed by Mathematical Reviews as an "excellent book which will become a basic reference." This paper-back edition of the 1993 edition, is designed to meet the many technological challenges facing the scientist and engineer. Concentrating on the three areas of geostatistical data, lattice data, and point patterns, the book sheds light on the link between data and model, revealing how design, inference, and diagnostics are an outgrowth of that link. It then explores new methods to reveal just how spatial statistical models can be used to solve important problems in a host of areas in science and engineering. Discussion includes: exploratory spatial data analysis, spectral theory for stationary processes, spatial scale, simulation methods for spatial processes, spatial bootstrapping, statistical image analysis and remote sensing, computational aspects of model fitting, application of models to disease mapping. Designed to accommodate the practical needs of the professional, it features a unified and common notation for its subject as well as many detailed examples woven into the text, numerous illustrations (including graphs that illuminate the theory discussed) and over 1,000 references. Fully balancing theory with applications, Statistics for Spatial Data, Revised Edition is an exceptionally clear guide on making optimal use of one of the ascendant analytical tools of the decade, one that has begun to capture the imagination of professionals in biology, earth science, civil, electrical, and agricultural engineering, geography, epidemiology, and ecology.},

Traditional interpolation methods, such as nearest-neighbor or bilinear resampling, do not take full advantage of the spatial information in the image. An alternative method, a geostatistical technique known as indicator kriging, is described and demonstrated using a Landsat Thematic Mapper image in southern Chiapas, Mexico. The image was first classified into pasture and nonpasture land cover. For each pixel that was obscured by cloud or cloud shadow, the probability that it was pasture was assigned by the algorithm. An exponential omnidirectional variogram model was used to characterize the spatial continuity of the image for use in the kriging algorithm. Assuming a cutoff probability level of 50\%, the error was shown to be 17\% with no obvious spatial bias but with some tendency to categorize nonpasture as pasture (overestimation). While this is a promising result, the method's practical application in other missing data problems for remotely sensed images will depend on the amount and spatial pattern of the unobscured pixels and missing pixels and the success of the spatial continuity model used.},

This study focuses on introducing geostatistical techniques for interpolating the DN values of clouded pixels in multispectral remotely sensed images using traditional ordinary cokriging and standardized ordinary cokriging. Two case studies were conducted in this study. The first case study shows that the methods work well for the small clouds in a heterogeneous landscape even when the images being combined show high temporal variability. Although the basic spatial structure in large size clouds can be captured, image interpolation‐related artefacts such as smoothing effects are visually apparent in a heterogeneous landscape. The second case study indicates that the cokriging methods work better in homogenous regions such as the dominantly agricultural areas in United States Midwest. Various statistics including both global statistics and local statistics are employed to confirm the reliability of the methods.},

A standard approach is to assume that the process of interest follows a Gaussian Process with some mean and (valid) covariance functions. It is common to model the covariance function as the product between a variance parameter, and a correlation function which is a function of the Euclidean distance between locations. This implies that the distribution of the process is unchanged when the origin of the index set is translated, and the process is invariant under rotation about the origin; that is the process is stationary and isotropic or homogeneous. However, the assumption of stationarity and isotropy (homogeneity) rarely holds in practice. Commonly, the correlation structures of such processes are influenced by local characteristics resulting in different behaviors in neighborhoods of different spatial locations. We review models that allow for heterogeneous covariance structures and point to some avenues of future research.},

	abstract = {A spline is a thin flexible strip composed of a material such as bamboo or steel that can be bent to pass through or near given points in the plane, or in 3-space in a smooth manner. Mechanical engineers and drafting specialists find such (physical) splines useful in designing and in drawing plans for a wide variety of objects, such as for hulls of boats or for the bodies of automobiles where smooth curves need to be specified. These days, physi­ cal splines are largely replaced by computer software that can compute the desired curves (with appropriate encouragment). The same mathematical ideas used for computing "spline" curves can be extended to allow us to compute "spline" surfaces. The application ofthese mathematical ideas is rather widespread. Spline functions are central to computer graphics disciplines. Spline curves and surfaces are used in computer graphics renderings for both real and imagi­ nary objects. Computer-aided-design (CAD) systems depend on algorithms for computing spline functions, and splines are used in numerical analysis and statistics. Thus the construction of movies and computer games trav­ els side-by-side with the art of automobile design, sail construction, and architecture; and statisticians and applied mathematicians use splines as everyday computational tools, often divorced from graphic images.},

	abstract = {A general method for constructing low-rank tensor product smooths for use as components of generalized additive models or generalized additive mixed models is presented. A penalized regression approach is adopted in which tensor product smooths of several variables are constructed from smooths of each variable separately, these "marginal" smooths being represented using a low-rank basis with an associated quadratic wiggliness penalty. The smooths offer several advantages: (i) they have one wiggliness penalty per covariate and are hence invariant to linear rescaling of covariates, making them useful when there is no "natural" way to scale covariates relative to each other; (ii) they have a useful tuneable range of smoothness, unlike single-penalty tensor product smooths that are scale invariant; (iii) the relatively low rank of the smooths means that they are computationally efficient; (iv) the penalties on the smooths are easily interpretable in terms of function shape; (v) the smooths can be generated completely automatically from any marginal smoothing bases and associated quadratic penalties, giving the modeler considerable flexibility to choose the basis penalty combination most appropriate to each modeling task; and (vi) the smooths can easily be written as components of a standard linear or generalized linear mixed model, allowing them to be used as components of the rich family of such models implemented in standard software, and to take advantage of the efficient and stable computational methods that have been developed for such models. A small simulation study shows that the methods can compare favorably with recently developed smoothing spline ANOVA methods.},

Nonstationary covariance functions allow the model to adapt to spatial surfaces whose variability changes with location. The class includes a nonstationary version of the Matérn stationary covariance, in which the differentiability of the spatial surface is controlled by a parameter, freeing one from fixing the differentiability in advance. The class allows one to knit together local covariance parameters into a valid global nonstationary covariance, regardless of how the local covariance structure is estimated. We employ this new nonstationary covariance in a fully Bayesian model in which the unknown spatial process has a Gaussian process (GP) prior distribution with a nonstationary covariance function from the class. We model the nonstationary structure in a computationally efficient way that creates nearly stationary local behavior and for which stationarity is a special case. We also suggest non-Bayesian approaches to nonstationary kriging., To assess the method, we use real climate data to compare the Bayesian nonstationary GP model with a Bayesian stationary GP model, various standard spatial smoothing approaches, and nonstationary models that can adapt to function heterogeneity. The GP models outperform the competitors, but while the nonstationary GP gives qualitatively more sensible results, it shows little advantage over the stationary GP on held-out data, illustrating the difficulty in fitting complicated spatial data.},

	abstract = {Let fλ be the regularized solution for the problem of estimating a function or vector f0 from noisy data yi = Lif0 + εi, i = 1, …, n, where Li are linear functionals. A prominent method for the selection of the crucial regularization parameter λ is generalized cross-validation (GCV). It is known that GCV has good asymptotic properties as n → ∞ but it may not be reliable for small or medium sized n, sometimes giving an estimate that is far too small. We propose a new robust GCV method (RGCV) which chooses λ to be the minimizer of γV(λ) + (1 − γ)F(λ), where V(λ) is the GCV function, F(λ) is an approximate average measure of the influence of each data point on fλ and γ ∊ (0, 1) is a robustness parameter. We show that for any n, RGCV is less likely than GCV to choose a very small value of λ, resulting in a more robust method. We also show that RGCV has good asymptotic properties as n → ∞ for general linear operator equations with uncorrelated errors. The function EF(λ) approximates the risk ER(λ) for values of λ that are asymptotically a bit smaller than the minimizer of ER(λ) (where V(λ) may not approximate well). The ‘expected’ RGCV estimate is asymptotically optimal as n → ∞ with respect to the ‘robust risk’ γER(λ) + (1 − γ)v(λ), where v(λ) is the variance component of the risk, and it has the optimal decay rate with respect to ER(λ) and stronger error criteria. The GCV and RGCV methods are compared in numerical simulations for the problem of estimating the second derivative from noisy data. The results for RGCV with n = 51 are consistent with the asymptotic results, and, for a large range of γ values, RGCV is more reliable and accurate than GCV.},

	abstract = {Estimation of the covariance structure of spatial processes is a fundamental prerequisite for problems of spatial interpolation and the design of monitoring networks. We introduce a nonparametric approach to global estimation of the spatial covariance structure of a random function Z(x, t) observed repeatedly at times ti (i = 1, ⋯, T) at a finite number of sampling stations xi (i = 1, 2, ..., N) in the plane. Our analyses assume temporal stationarity but do not assume spatial stationarity (or isotropy). We analyze the spatial dispersions \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{var\}(Z(x\_i, t) - Z(x\_j, t))\$ as a natural metric for the spatial covariance structure and model these as a general smooth function of the geographic coordinate of station pairs (xi, xj). The model is constructed in two steps. First, using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) we compute a two-dimensional representation of the sampling stations for which a monotone function of interpoint distances δij approximates the spatial dispersions. MDS transforms the problem into one for which the covariance structure, expressed in terms of spatial dispersions, is stationary and isotropic. Second, we compute thinplate splines to provide smooth mappings of the geographic representation of the sampling stations into their MDS representation. The composition of this mapping f and a monotone function g derived from MDS yields a nonparametric estimator of \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{var\}(Z(x\_a, t) - Z(x\_b, t))\$ for any two geographic locations xa and xb (monitored or not) of the form g(∣ f(xa) - f(xb(∣). By restricting the monotone function g to a class of conditionally nonpositive definite variogram functions, we ensure that the resulting nonparametric model corresponds to a nonnegative definite covariance model. We use biorthogonal grids, introduced by Bookstein in the field of morphometrics, to depict the thin-plate spline mappings that embody the nature of the anisotropy and nonstationarity in the sample covariance matrix. An analysis of mesoscale variability in solar radiation monitored in southwestern British Columbia demonstrates this methodology.},

	abstract = {Summary. Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Matérn class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of , between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

The present paper addresses this question when using local polynomial approximations for estimating the regression function and its derivatives. A fully-automatic bandwidth selection procedure has been proposed by Fan and Gijbels (1995a), and the empirical performance of it was tested in detail via a variety of examples. Those experiences supported the methodology towards a great extend. In this paper we establish asymptotic results for the proposed variable bandwidth selector. We provide the rate of convergence of the bandwidth estimate, and obtain the asymptotic distribution of its error relative to the theoretical optimal variable bandwidth. These asymptotic properties give extra support to the proposed bandwidth selection procedure. It is also demonstrated how the proposed selection method can be applied in the density estimation setup. some examples illustrate this application.},

	abstract = {Ill-posed inverse problems arise in many branches of science and engineering. In the typical situation one is interested in recovering a whole function given a finite number of noisy measurements on functionals. Performance characteristics of an inversion algorithm are studied via the mean square error which is decomposed into bias and variability. Variability calculations are often straightforward, but useful bias measures are more difficult to obtain. An appropriate definition of what geophysicists call the Backus-Gilbert averaging kernel leads to a natural way of measuring bias characteristics. Moreover, the ideas give rise to some important experimental design criteria. It can be shown that the optimal inversion algorithms are methods of regularization procedures, but to completely specify these algorithms the signal to noise ratio must be supplied. Statistical approaches to the empirical determination of the signal to noise ratio are discussed; cross-validation and unbiased risk methods are reviewed; and some extensions, which seem particularly appropriate in the inverse problem context, are indicated. Linear and nonlinear examples from medicine, meteorology, and geophysics are used for illustration.},

It is shown that if the true, unknown function being estimated is smooth in a sense to be defined then the GML estimate undersmooths relative to the GCV estimate and the predictive mean square error using the GML estimate goes to zero at a slower rate than the mean square error using the GCV estimate.

Two extensions of GCV called robust GCV (RGCV) and modified GCV have been proposed as more stable criteria. Each involves a parameter that must be chosen, but the only guidance has come from simulation results. We investigate the performance of the criteria analytically. In most studies, the mean square prediction error is the only loss function considered. Here, we use both the prediction error and a stronger Sobolev norm error, which provides a better measure of the quality of the estimate. A geometric approach is used to analyse the superior small-sample stability of RGCV compared to GCV. In addition, by deriving the asymptotic inefficiency for both the prediction error and the Sobolev error, we find intervals for the parameters of RGCV and modified GCV for which the criteria have optimal performance.},

	abstract = {Numerous nonparametric regression methods exist that yield consistent estimators of function curves. Often, one is also interested in constructing confidence intervals for the unknown function. When a function estimate is based on a single global smoothing parameter the resulting confidence intervals may hold their desired confidence level 1 -α on average but because bias in nonparametric estimation is not uniform, they do not hold the desired level uniformly at all design points. Most research in this area has focused on mean squared error properties of the estimator, for example MISE, itself a global measure. In addition, measures like MISE are one step removed from the practical issue of coverage probability. Recent work that focuses on coverage probability has considered only coverage in an average sense, ignoring the important issue of uniformity of coverage across the design space. To deal with this problem, a new estimator is developed which uses a local cross-validation criterion (LCV) to determine a separate smoothing parameter for each design point. The local smoothing parameters are then used to compute the point estimators of the regression curve and the corresponding pointwise confidence intervals. Incorporation of local information through the new method is shown, via Monte Carlo simulation, to yield more uniformly valid pointwise confidence intervals for nonparametric regression curves. Diagnostic plots are developed (Breakout Plots) to visually inspect the degree of uniformity of coverage of the confidence intervals. The approach, here applied to cubic smoothing splines, easily generalizes to many other nonparametric regression estimators. The improved curve estimation is not a solely theoretical improvement such as providing an estimator that has a faster EASE convergence rate but shows its worth empirically by yielding improved coverage probabilities through reliable pointwise confidence intervals.},

	abstract = {Age–sex-specific population forecasts are derived through stochastic population renewal using forecasts of mortality, fertility and net migration. Functional data models with time series coefficients are used to model age-specific mortality and fertility rates. As detailed migration data are lacking, net migration by age and sex is estimated as the difference between historic annual population data and successive populations one year ahead derived from a projection using fertility and mortality data. This estimate, which includes error, is also modeled using a functional data model. The three models involve different strengths of the general Box–Cox transformation chosen to minimise out-of-sample forecast error. Uncertainty is estimated from the model, with an adjustment to ensure that the one-step-forecast variances are equal to those obtained with historical data. The three models are then used in a Monte Carlo simulation of future fertility, mortality and net migration, which are combined using the cohort-component method to obtain age-specific forecasts of the population by sex. The distribution of the forecasts provides probabilistic prediction intervals. The method is demonstrated by making 20-year forecasts using Australian data for the period 1921–2004. The advantages of our method are: (1) it is a coherent stochastic model of the three demographic components; (2) it is estimated entirely from historical data with no subjective inputs required; and (3) it provides probabilistic prediction intervals for any demographic variable that is derived from population numbers and vital events, including life expectancies, total fertility rates and dependency ratios.},

	abstract = {We develop a weighted local likelihood estimate for the parameters that govern the local spatial dependency of a locally stationary random field. The advantage of this local likelihood estimate is that it smoothly downweights the influence of faraway observations, works for irregular sampling locations, and when designed appropriately, can trade bias and variance for reducing estimation error. This paper starts with an exposition of our technique on the problem of estimating an unknown positive function when multiplied by a stationary random field. This example gives concrete evidence of the benefits of our local likelihood as compared to unweighted local likelihoods. We then discuss the difficult problem of estimating a bandwidth parameter that controls the amount of influence from distant observations. Finally we present a simulation experiment for estimating the local smoothness of a local Matérn random field when observing the field at random sampling locations in [0,1]2. The local Matérn is a fully nonstationary random field, has a closed form covariance, can attain any degree of differentiability or Hölder smoothness and behaves locally like a stationary Matérn. We include an appendix that proves the positive definiteness of this covariance function.},

	title = {Bayesian {Gaussian} {Processes} for {Regression} and {Classi} cation},
	abstract = {Bayesian inference offers us a powerful tool with which to tackle the problem of data modelling. However, the performance of Bayesian methods is crucially dependent on being able to find good models for our data. The principal focus of this thesis is the development of models based on Gaussian process priors. Such models, which can be thought of as the infinite extension of several existing finite models, have the flexibility to model complex phenomena while being mathematically simple. In thesis, I present a review of the theory of Gaussian processes and their covariance functions and demonstrate how they fit into the Bayesian framework. The efficient implementation of a Gaussian process is discussed with particular reference to approximate methods for matrix inversion based on the work of Skilling (1993). Several regression problems are examined. Non-stationary covariance functions are developed for the regression of neuron spike data and the use of Gaussian processes to model the potential energy surfaces of weakly bound molecules is discussed. Classification methods based on Gaussian processes are implemented using variational methods. Existing bounds (Jaakkola and Jordan 1996) for the sigmoid function are used to tackle binary problems and multi-dimensional bounds on the softmax function are presented for the multiple class case. The performance of the variational classifier is compared with that of other methods using the CRABS and PIMA datasets (Ripley 1996) and the problem of predicting the cracking of welds based on their chemical composition is also investigated. The theoretical calculation of the density of states of crystal structures is discussed in detail. Three possible approaches to the problem are described based on free energy minimization, Gaussian processes and the theory of random matrices. Results from these approaches are compared with the state-of-the-art techniques (Pickard 1997)},
