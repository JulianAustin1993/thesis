We introduce simple closed form kernels that can be used with Gaussian processes to discover patterns and enable extrapolation. These kernels are derived by modeling a spectral density – the Fourier transform of a kernel – with a Gaussian mixture. The proposed kernels support a broad class of stationary covariances, but Gaussian process inference remains simple and analytic. We demonstrate the proposed kernels by discovering patterns and performing long range extrapolation on synthetic examples, as well as atmospheric CO2 trends and airline passenger data. We also show that it is possible to reconstruct several popular standard covariances within our framework.},

	title = {Bayesian {Gaussian} {Processes} for {Regression} and {Classi} cation},
	abstract = {Bayesian inference offers us a powerful tool with which to tackle the problem of data modelling. However, the performance of Bayesian methods is crucially dependent on being able to find good models for our data. The principal focus of this thesis is the development of models based on Gaussian process priors. Such models, which can be thought of as the infinite extension of several existing finite models, have the flexibility to model complex phenomena while being mathematically simple. In thesis, I present a review of the theory of Gaussian processes and their covariance functions and demonstrate how they fit into the Bayesian framework. The efficient implementation of a Gaussian process is discussed with particular reference to approximate methods for matrix inversion based on the work of Skilling (1993). Several regression problems are examined. Non-stationary covariance functions are developed for the regression of neuron spike data and the use of Gaussian processes to model the potential energy surfaces of weakly bound molecules is discussed. Classification methods based on Gaussian processes are implemented using variational methods. Existing bounds (Jaakkola and Jordan 1996) for the sigmoid function are used to tackle binary problems and multi-dimensional bounds on the softmax function are presented for the multiple class case. The performance of the variational classifier is compared with that of other methods using the CRABS and PIMA datasets (Ripley 1996) and the problem of predicting the cracking of welds based on their chemical composition is also investigated. The theoretical calculation of the density of states of crystal structures is discussed in detail. Three possible approaches to the problem are described based on free energy minimization, Gaussian processes and the theory of random matrices. Results from these approaches are compared with the state-of-the-art techniques (Pickard 1997)},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

This architecture gives ﬂexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous “parameter server” designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural networks.

Compactly supported kernels and separable nonstationary kernels are of prime interest because they provide a computational reduction for kernel-based methods. We describe the spectral representation of the various classes of kernels and conclude with a discussion on the characterization of nonlinear maps that reduce nonstationary kernels to either stationarity or local stationarity.},

              Gaussian process model for vector-valued function has been shown to be useful for multi-output prediction. The existing method for this model is to reformulate the matrix-variate Gaussian distribution as a multivariate normal distribution. Although it is effective in many cases, reformulation is not always workable and is difficult to apply to other distributions because not all matrix-variate distributions can be transformed to respective multivariate distributions, such as the case for matrix-variate Student-
              t
              distribution. In this paper, we propose a unified framework which is used not only to introduce a novel multivariate Student-
              t
              process regression model (MV-TPR) for multi-output prediction, but also to reformulate the multivariate Gaussian process regression (MV-GPR) that overcomes some limitations of the existing methods. Both MV-GPR and MV-TPR have closed-form expressions for the marginal likelihoods and predictive distributions under this unified framework and thus can adopt the same optimization approaches as used in the conventional GPR. The usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated through several simulated and real-data examples. In particular, we verify empirically that MV-TPR has superiority for the datasets considered, including air quality prediction and bike rent prediction. At last, the proposed methods are shown to produce profitable investment strategies in the stock markets.},

	abstract = {A decisive question in nonparametric smoothing techniques is the choice of the bandwidth or smoothing parameter. The present paper addresses this question when using local polynomial approximations for estimating the regression function and its derivatives. A fully-automatic bandwidth selection procedure has been proposed by Fan and Gijbels (1995a), and the empirical performance of it was tested in detail via a variety of examples. Those experiences supported the methodology towards a great extend. In this paper we establish asymptotic results for the proposed variable bandwidth selector. We provide the rate of convergence of the bandwidth estimate, and obtain the asymptotic distribution of its error relative to the theoretical optimal variable bandwidth. These asymptotic properties give extra support to the proposed bandwidth selection procedure. It is also demonstrated how the proposed selection method can be applied in the density estimation setup. some examples illustrate this application.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            While internal climate variability is known to affect climate projections, its influence is often underappreciated and confused with model error. Why? In general, modeling centers contribute a small number of realizations to international climate model assessments [e.g., phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)]. As a result, model error and internal climate variability are difficult, and at times impossible, to disentangle. In response, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) community designed the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) with the explicit goal of enabling assessment of climate change in the presence of internal climate variability. All CESM-LE simulations use a single CMIP5 model (CESM with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5). The core simulations replay the twenty to twenty-first century (1920–2100) 30 times under historical and representative concentration pathway 8.5 external forcing with small initial condition differences. Two companion 1000+-yr-long preindustrial control simulations (fully coupled, prognostic atmosphere and land only) allow assessment of internal climate variability in the absence of climate change. Comprehensive outputs, including many daily fields, are available as single-variable time series on the Earth System Grid for anyone to use. Early results demonstrate the substantial influence of internal climate variability on twentieth- to twenty-first-century climate trajectories. Global warming hiatus decades occur, similar to those recently observed. Internal climate variability alone can produce projection spread comparable to that in CMIP5. Scientists and stakeholders can use CESM-LE outputs to help interpret the observational record, to understand projection spread and to plan for a range of possible futures influenced by both internal climate variability and forced climate change.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is of huge economic significance in The Netherlands where the provision of real-time, reliable information on crop development is essential to support the transition towards precision agriculture. Optical imagery can provide invaluable insights into crop growth and development but is severely hampered by cloud cover. This case study in the Flevopolder illustrates the potential value of Sentinel-1 for monitoring five key crops in The Netherlands, namely sugar beet, potato, maize, wheat and English rye grass. Time series of radar backscatter from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 Mission are analyzed and compared to ground measurements including phenological stage and height. Temporal variations in backscatter data reflect changes in water content and structure associated with phenological development. Emergence and closure dates are estimated from the backscatter time series and validated against a photo archive. Coherence data are compared to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and ground data, illustrating that the sudden increase in coherence is a useful indicator of harvest. The results presented here demonstrate that Sentinel-1 data have significant potential value to monitor growth and development of key Dutch crops. Furthermore, the guaranteed availability of Sentinel-1 imagery in clouded conditions ensures the reliability of data to meet the monitoring needs of farmers, food producers and regulatory bodies.},
